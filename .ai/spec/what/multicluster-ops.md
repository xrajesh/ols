# Multicluster Operations

Cross-repo specification for fleet-scale agentic operations. A central hub cluster manages spoke clusters, routing alerts and agentic workflows across the fleet through a single control plane.

> **Testing:** how this feature is tested is specified separately in [multicluster-testing.md](multicluster-testing.md).

## Repos Involved

| Repo | Role |
|---|---|
| lightspeed-hub | Hub operator: SpokeCluster CRs, credential broker, adapter orchestrator, spoke watcher |
| lightspeed-hub-ui | Hub console: fleet dashboard, spoke management, approval UI |
| lightspeed-agentic-operator | AgenticRun reconciliation, `spec.targetCluster` support, ephemeral SA lifecycle on spoke |
| lightspeed-agentic-alerts-adapter | Standalone adapter: runs on hub, polls spoke AlertManagers |

## Architecture

### Hub-Managed Mode (MVP)

The hub is both control plane and compute plane. Sandboxes run on the hub, targeting spoke clusters via remote kube-api. Spoke footprint is minimal — ephemeral SA per run only. [PLANNED] AgenticRun CRD installed on spoke for embedded adapters.

### Spoke-Local Mode [PLANNED]

The hub is control plane only. Full agentic stack deployed to spoke. Sandboxes run locally on spoke. AgenticRun CRs live on the spoke, synced to hub via mirror CRs for fleet visibility. Approval routed from hub console back to spoke.

## Deployment Modes — Summary

| Concern | Hub-Managed (MVP) | Spoke-Local [PLANNED] |
|---|---|---|
| AgenticRun CRs live on | Hub (standalone adapters); [PLANNED] + spoke (embedded adapters) | Spoke |
| Who reconciles AgenticRuns | Hub's agentic-operator | Spoke's agentic-operator |
| Sandbox runs on | Hub | Spoke |
| Sandbox reaches spoke via | Remote kube-api (ephemeral SA token) | Local kube-api |
| Standalone adapters | Run on hub, poll spoke remotely | Run on spoke, watch locally |
| Embedded adapters | [PLANNED] Create AgenticRun locally on spoke; hub watches | Create AgenticRun locally on spoke |
| LLM credentials | Hub only | Distributed to spoke |
| Fleet visibility | Direct (hub CRs) + watched (spoke CRs) | Aggregated via mirror CRs |
| Approval | Hub UI → hub AgenticRun | Hub UI → mirror CR → hub operator writes to spoke |
| Hub compute scaling | Linear with spoke count | Constant |
| Best for | ROSA, managed services, edge | Self-managed, resource-rich |

## CRDs

### New CRDs (hub.openshift.io/v1alpha1)

1. **HubConfig** — cluster-scoped singleton. Fleet-level configuration: `spec.clusterRegistryMode` (`secret` or `mce`). In `secret` mode, admin creates SpokeCluster CRs manually. In `mce` mode, hub operator auto-discovers spokes from MCE `ManagedCluster` CRs matching an optional label selector (`spec.mce.selector.matchLabels`).
2. **SpokeCluster** — cluster-scoped, one per spoke. Manages spoke identity, credentials, connectivity, and status. See `lightspeed-hub/.ai/spec/what/spoke-lifecycle.md`.

### Modified CRDs (agentic.openshift.io/v1alpha1)

3. **AgenticRun** — new optional field `spec.targetCluster` referencing a SpokeCluster by name. When set, the agentic-operator creates an ephemeral SA on the spoke and mounts a spoke kubeconfig into the sandbox. When empty, behaves as today (local cluster).

### Planned CRDs [PLANNED]

4. **MirrorAgenticRun** (hub.openshift.io/v1alpha1) — spoke-local mode only. Lightweight copy of a spoke-side AgenticRun synced to hub for console access and approval routing.

## End-to-End Flow — Hub-Managed Mode

### Standalone Adapter Path (alerts-adapter)

1. A single alerts-adapter instance on the hub watches `SpokeCluster` CRs and polls each spoke's AlertManager via a dedicated per-spoke kubeconfig Secret (`spoke-alert-kubeconfig-{spoke-name}`), separate from the standing kubeconfig. See [alerts-adapter-multicluster.md](alerts-adapter-multicluster.md) for details.
2. Adapter creates AgenticRun CR on hub with `spec.targetCluster` set to the SpokeCluster name.
3. Hub's agentic-operator detects the new AgenticRun. Reads the standing kubeconfig Secret by naming convention: `spoke-kubeconfig-{targetCluster}`. Builds a `rest.Config` from it (transparently routes through MCE proxy if `proxy-url` is present).
4. **Analysis phase**: Agentic-operator creates a per-step SA (`ls-anl-{run-UID}`) on the spoke via remote kube-api using the standing kubeconfig. Adds the SA to the `lightspeed-agent` reader ClusterRoleBindings on the spoke (same `addReaderSubject` pattern as single-cluster mode). Calls TokenRequest API on the spoke for a 24h token. Creates a sandbox kubeconfig Secret on the hub (`ls-sandbox-kubeconfig-{run-name}-analysis`) with spoke API server + ephemeral token + proxy-url (if present). Mounts into sandbox pod.
5. **Approval gate**: User approves in hub console.
6. **Execution phase**: Agentic-operator creates a per-step SA (`ls-exe-{run-UID}`) on the spoke. Adds reader access (same as analysis). Additionally creates namespace-scoped Roles + RoleBindings on the spoke for write access based on the approved option's RBAC requirements. Gets 24h token. Creates execution sandbox kubeconfig Secret. Mounts into sandbox pod.
7. **Verification phase**: Creates per-step SA (`ls-ver-{run-UID}`) with reader access only (same as analysis). Gets token, creates kubeconfig, mounts into sandbox.
8. Standard agentic lifecycle for each phase (see `agentic-runs.md`). All sandbox operations target the spoke via remote kube-api through the mounted kubeconfig.
9. On terminal phase (completed, failed, escalated): agentic-operator deletes all per-step SAs and their RoleBindings on the spoke. Removes per-step SAs from reader ClusterRoleBindings. Deletes sandbox kubeconfig Secrets on the hub (auto-GC via owner reference to AgenticRun). Deletes sandbox pods.
10. Token TTL (24h) is the safety net if cleanup fails.

### Embedded Adapter Path [PLANNED]

1. Hub operator installs AgenticRun CRD on spoke during registration.
2. Existing spoke-side operator (CVO, ACS, CMO) detects a domain-specific event.
3. Operator creates an AgenticRun CR locally on the spoke using standard Kubernetes API. No hub awareness needed — just import the CRD types and call `Create()`.
4. Hub's agentic-operator watches AgenticRun CRs on the spoke via a dedicated watcher (Kubernetes informer on the remote cluster). Detects the new CR.
5. From here, same as standalone path steps 3–9.

## Identity Model

### Standing Kubeconfig

The hub operator creates a normalized kubeconfig Secret per spoke during registration: `spoke-kubeconfig-{spoke-name}`. This is the integration contract between the hub operator and the agentic-operator. Standalone adapters (e.g., alerts-adapter) use their own per-spoke credential Secrets — see [alerts-adapter-multicluster.md](alerts-adapter-multicluster.md).

| Credential source | What the standing kubeconfig contains | MVP |
|---|---|---|
| `secret` | Spoke API server URL + admin-provided kubeconfig credentials | Yes |
| `mce` | Spoke API server URL + MCE proxy-url + hub SA token authorized for MCE cluster-proxy | Yes |
| `backplane` | Spoke API server URL + backplane-issued token | [PLANNED] |

The `proxy-url` field in the kubeconfig is handled transparently by Go's HTTP transport. Consumers call `clientcmd.RESTConfigFromKubeConfig()` and get a `rest.Config` that routes through the MCE proxy automatically — no MCE-specific code in the agentic-operator or adapters.

Permissions the standing identity needs on the spoke: create/delete ServiceAccounts, Roles, RoleBindings; TokenRequest API; read AlertManager, nodes, namespaces.

### Spoke-Side Reader RBAC (provisioned at registration)

During spoke registration, the hub operator creates:
- `openshift-lightspeed-managed` namespace on the spoke (separate from `openshift-lightspeed` to avoid collisions with a spoke-local OLS installation)
- `lightspeed-agent` SA in `openshift-lightspeed-managed` on the spoke
- `cluster-reader` and `cluster-monitoring-view` ClusterRoleBindings referencing `openshift-lightspeed-managed/lightspeed-agent`

This establishes the same reader RBAC pattern used in single-cluster mode. The agentic-operator's `addReaderSubject` discovers these ClusterRoleBindings and adds per-step SAs to them — identical code path for local and remote clusters. The separate namespace ensures no conflicts if the spoke also has its own standalone OLS installation.

### Per-Step SAs (per-AgenticRun)

Created by the agentic-operator for each step of an AgenticRun targeting a spoke. Same naming convention and RBAC pattern as single-cluster mode, but SAs are created on the spoke via remote kube-api using the standing kubeconfig.

| Step | SA name | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Analysis | `ls-anl-{run-UID}` | Cluster-wide read (via reader ClusterRoleBindings) |
| Execution | `ls-exe-{run-UID}` | Cluster-wide read + namespace-scoped write (from approved option RBAC) |
| Verification | `ls-ver-{run-UID}` | Cluster-wide read (via reader ClusterRoleBindings) |
| Escalation | `ls-esc-{run-UID}` | Cluster-wide read (via reader ClusterRoleBindings) |

For each step, the agentic-operator:
1. Creates the per-step SA on the spoke (via standing kubeconfig)
2. Calls `addReaderSubject` to add the SA to reader ClusterRoleBindings on the spoke
3. For execution only: creates namespace-scoped Roles + RoleBindings for write access
4. Calls TokenRequest API on the spoke → 24h bound token
5. Creates a sandbox kubeconfig Secret on the hub with spoke API server + proxy-url (if present) + ephemeral token
6. Mounts the sandbox kubeconfig into the sandbox pod as `KUBECONFIG`

### Sandbox Kubeconfig Secret

Per-step kubeconfig Secret created on the hub for mounting into sandbox pods:
- Name: `ls-sandbox-kubeconfig-{run-name}-{step}`
- Contains: spoke API server URL + proxy-url (copied from standing kubeconfig if present) + per-step SA token
- Owner reference to AgenticRun CR (auto-GC)
- The sandbox pod sets `automountServiceAccountToken: false` and uses the mounted `KUBECONFIG` instead

The proxy-url copy is mechanical — no conditional logic:
```go
sandboxCluster.ProxyURL = standingCluster.ProxyURL  // empty string if not MCE
```

### Cross-Cluster Cleanup

Owner references do not work across clusters. Cleanup is explicit:

1. **Labels**: All spoke-side resources labeled with `hub.openshift.io/spoke-cluster` and `hub.openshift.io/agentic-run`.
2. **Finalizer**: Finalizer on AgenticRun CR. Controller removes spoke-side resources (per-step SAs, Roles, RoleBindings) and removes SA subjects from reader ClusterRoleBindings before releasing the finalizer.
3. **Token TTL**: 24h token expiry as safety net. Periodic reconciliation sweeps stale SAs.
4. **Hub-side cleanup**: Sandbox kubeconfig Secrets are auto-GC'd via owner reference to AgenticRun.

## Console Integration

The hub console is the single control plane for all modes. Console plugins can only read resources from the cluster they run on (the hub).

- **Hub-managed mode (MVP)**: AgenticRun CRs from standalone adapters live on the hub — console reads them directly. [PLANNED] AgenticRun CRs from embedded adapters live on the spoke — hub operator's spoke watcher caches status for the console.
- **Spoke-local mode [PLANNED]**: Console reads MirrorAgenticRun CRs on the hub. Approval actions on mirror CRs are propagated by the hub operator to the spoke.

## Connectivity

MVP uses direct kube-api connectivity. The admin ensures network path between hub and spoke (VPN, peering, same-VPC).

[PLANNED] Reverse tunnel via apiserver-network-proxy (ANP) for firewalled spokes. MCE cluster-proxy connectivity abstraction. Connection Factory pattern returning `rest.Config` with the right transport.

## Security Invariants

1. In hub-managed mode, LLM provider credentials never leave the hub.
2. Ephemeral SA tokens are scoped to `targetNamespaces` only — no cluster-wide write access on spoke.
3. Standing identity credentials (spoke kubeconfigs) are stored as K8s Secrets on the hub, encrypted at rest.
4. Hub namespace RBAC restricts which users/SAs can read spoke credential Secrets.
5. Credential Secrets are labeled for audit (`hub.openshift.io/credential-type: spoke-kubeconfig`).

## What Does NOT Change

- OLSConfig CR and LLM provider configuration
- MCP server definitions and tool filtering
- Sandbox runtime (lightspeed-agentic-sandbox)
- Agent and LLMProvider CRDs
- ApprovalPolicy enforcement
- Single-cluster deployment mode (continues to work with no hub)
