# System Overview

OpenShift Lightspeed (OLS) is an AI-powered assistant for OpenShift clusters. It answers user questions about OpenShift/Kubernetes using LLM backends augmented with retrieval from product documentation (RAG), and can execute agentic workflows to diagnose and remediate cluster issues.

## Product Layers

### Classic OLS

The core Q&A assistant. A user asks a question in the console, the service processes it through RAG retrieval and LLM generation (with optional tool calling), and streams back an answer.

1. **lightspeed-service** (Python/FastAPI) — Backend. Owns the query pipeline, LLM provider abstraction, OKP-based knowledge retrieval (via Solr hybrid search), BYOK FAISS retrieval, conversation caching, quota management, MCP tool integration, and skill execution. Spec: `lightspeed-service/.ai/spec/README.md`
2. **lightspeed-operator** (Go/kubebuilder) — Kubernetes operator. Reconciles the `OLSConfig` CR to deploy and manage the service, console plugin, PostgreSQL, and all supporting resources. Spec: `lightspeed-operator/.ai/spec/README.md`
3. **lightspeed-console** (TypeScript/React) — OpenShift console plugin. Floating chat UI for the assistant, handles streaming responses, context attachment (YAML/logs), conversation history, and tool result visualization. Guide: `lightspeed-console/AGENTS.md`
4. **lightspeed-rag-content** (Python) — BYOK tooling. Provides the BYOK tool image for customers to build FAISS vector indexes from their own Markdown documentation. The main RAG content image (OCP product docs FAISS indexes) is deprecated — OCP docs are now served by OKP via the RHOKP sidecar. Spec: `lightspeed-rag-content/.ai/spec/README.md`

### Agentic OLS

Autonomous cluster operations. Alerts or user requests trigger multi-phase AI workflows (analysis → approval → execution → verification) that can take actions on the cluster through sandboxed agents.

5. **lightspeed-agentic-operator** (Go/kubebuilder) — Orchestrates `AgenticRun` CRs through multi-phase workflows, manages sandbox pods, enforces approval policies, materializes RBAC for execution. Spec: `lightspeed-agentic-operator/.ai/spec/README.md`
6. **lightspeed-agentic-console** (TypeScript/React) — Console plugin providing the AI Hub UI for viewing, approving, and monitoring agentic runs. Configuration for approval policies, LLM providers, and agent tiers. Spec: `lightspeed-agentic-console/.ai/spec/README.md`
7. **lightspeed-agentic-sandbox** (Python/FastAPI) — Containerized agent runtime. Wraps multiple LLM provider SDKs (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI) behind a unified `/v1/agent/run` HTTP endpoint with structured output and tool execution. Spec: `lightspeed-agentic-sandbox/.ai/spec/README.md`
8. **lightspeed-agentic-alerts-adapter** (Go) — Stateless bridge. Polls AlertManager for firing alerts, creates `AgenticRun` CRs with deduplication and cooldown logic. Guide: `lightspeed-agentic-alerts-adapter/AGENTS.md`

### Tooling

9. **lightspeed-team-harness** — Shared AI coding skills and conventions for the team (dependency updates, CI failure investigation, PR workflows, CVE resolution). Guide: `lightspeed-team-harness/AGENTS.md`
10. **ols-load-generator** (Go) — Load testing tool. Measures OLS performance under concurrent query load, scrapes cluster Prometheus metrics. Guide: `ols-load-generator/README.md`

## Cross-Repo Features
